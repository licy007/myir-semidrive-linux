Semidrive cpufreq driver
-------------------

Semidrive SoC cpufreq driver for CPU frequency scaling.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "semidrive,sdrv-cpufreq".
- trans-delay-us: the delay time(us) for next scaling.
- start-time: the time which start after kernel boot (seconds).

Optional properties:
- frequency-list: define the freq table.
- min-freq: define the min freq.
- max-freq: define the max freq.
if no frequency-list, will use the min-freq and max-freq to calcurate the freqs.

Examples:
--------
    sdrvcpufreq: cpufreq {
                compatible = "semidrive,sdrv-cpufreq";
                min-freq = <100000000>; /* hz */
                max-freq = <0xffffffff>; /* driver will using the minimum value between this value and pll capability */
                frequency-list = <100000000 300000000 1100000000 1600000000>;
                trans-delay-us = <200000>;
                start-time = <10>; /*second*/
                status = "okay";
    };
