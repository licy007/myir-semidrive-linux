Semidrive X9 time_sync components
=====================
time-sync uses a C/S architecture to deliver time information through mailbox. That means server can
send time to client

Required properties :
 - compatible : should be "sd,time-sync"
 - mboxes ：    This is a phandle object consisting of 3 parts. The
 		first is a handle to mailbox node. The second is
                mailbox local address. The last is an unsigned short
                with high byte as mailbox remote address and low byte
                as mailbox remote processor ID. See semidrive-mailbox
                for details.
 - rproc ：     should be it own domain ID,where domain ID enum is,
 		safety:0
                sec:1
                mpc:2
                AP1:3
                AP2:4
 - sendto :     this consists 5 node,when the node is 1,it means the mailbox channel
		to remote domain is enable.otherwise,the channel is disable
 - master :     when master is 1,it will be a server,otherwise,it will be a client.

Examples :
	time_sync: time_sync {
		compatible = "sd,time-sync";
		mboxes = <&mbox 0xbd 0xbd00>,<&mbox 0xbd 0xbd01>,
				<&mbox 0xbd 0xbd02>,<&mbox 0xbd 0xbd03>,
				<&mbox 0xbd 0xbd04>;
		rproc = <3>;
		sendto = <1 0 0 0 1>;
		master = <1>;
		status = "okay";
	};
