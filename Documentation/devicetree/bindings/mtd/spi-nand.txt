* SPI NAND flash

Required properties:
- #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has sub-nodes
  representing partitions.
- compatible : "sdrv,spi-nor"
- reg : the base addr of ospi controler
- cdns,read-delay: the delay clock of read
- spi-max-frequency: the max clock frequency of spi
- page-size: NAND's page-size
- block-size: NAND's block-size
Example:

	spi-nand@0 {
		compatible = "spi-nand";
		cdns,read-delay = <1>;
		cdns,tshsl-ns = <50>;
		cdns,tsd2d-ns = <50>;
		cdns,tchsh-ns = <50>;
		cdns,tslch-ns = <50>;
		spi-max-frequency = <100000000>;
		reg = <0>;
		page-size = <256>;
		block-size = <12>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
