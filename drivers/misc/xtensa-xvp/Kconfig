config VDSP
	bool "xtensa vision dsp support"
	default n
	help
	  Choose this if you have a xetensa vision dsp like p6 and want to use
	  the dsp for opencl or nn.

config XRP
	tristate "XRP driver"
	depends on VDSP
	default n
	help
	  This is the core of Cadence Xtensa Remote Processing driver.
	  It should be enabled to support applications communicating with
	  Xtensa DSPs through the XRP API.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called xrp.

config XRP_DEBUG
	bool "Debug XRP"
	depends on XRP
	default n
	help
	  This enables verbose debug output of the XRP driver.

	  If unsure, say N.

config XRP_HW_SIMPLE
	tristate "XRP for simple hardware"
	depends on XRP
	default n
	help
	  This is hardware-specific XRP kernel driver for the simple
	  hardware. It should be enabled to support XRP on simple hardware
	  platforms.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called xrp_hw_simple.

config XRP_HW_SEMIDRIVE
	tristate "XRP for Semidrive x9"
	depends on XRP
	default n
	help
	  This is hardware-specific XRP kernel driver for the Semidrive x9
	  hardware. It should be enabled to support XRP on Semidrive hardware
	  platforms.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called xrp_hw_semidrive.

config XRP_HW_HIKEY960
	tristate "XRP for HiKey960"
	depends on XRP
	default n
	help
	  This is hardware-specific XRP kernel driver for the HiKey960
	  hardware. It should be enabled to support XRP on HiKey960
	  platform.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called xrp_hw_hikey960.
